The plotting scripts in this repository work with almost every matplotlib style sheet. These are some style adaptations I prefer. They are specified in the first line after the imports in every script. There you can switch to the light version manually.

If you do not have the Lato font installed (which is available here [fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato)) you can add it to you list of fonts by following this instruction: [python-graph-gallery.com/custom-fonts-in-matplotlib](https://python-graph-gallery.com/custom-fonts-in-matplotlib)

Or you do nothing and automatically use the matplotlib default font.
